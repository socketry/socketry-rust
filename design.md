# Future foundation

This document records the direction for Socketry's Rust foundation. The
executor now polls futures directly using async-task and Crossbeam queues,
with worker threads, work stealing and explicit task owners. The coroutine
prototype is preserved in commit `b520f3d` on branch `coroutine`. Portable TCP,
file and clock capabilities, native selectors and a Tokio adapter are now
implemented. The io-event timer port and further optimizations remain planned.

## Goals

- Port the useful designs and modular organization of Socketry's Ruby
  libraries into Rust.
- Use futures for task execution, with no private coroutine stack per task.
- Let applications choose a Socketry runtime, Tokio, or another implementation
  of the capabilities a library needs.
- Support Linux io_uring without compromising buffer lifetime or cancellation
  safety, with an explicit strategy for other platforms.
- Port io-event's timer algorithm and preserve its batching and cancellation
  behavior.
- Establish conventions and agent context that other Socketry crates can use.

## Shared interfaces and concrete implementations

Rust already standardizes the interface between a future and an executor:
`Future::poll`, `Context`, and `Waker`. Awaiting a future does not inherently
select a particular scheduler. Spawning tasks, creating timers, and opening
sockets require additional services, which are not all standardized by
`std::future`.

Make those services explicit. A library should receive the capabilities it
uses: a task owner, a clock, a connector, or an existing stream. Avoid requiring
a complete runtime just to parse a protocol or operate on an existing stream.

Zig's `std.Io` is a useful reference for passing an implementation into code.
The Rust translation uses future-returning operations and ordinary `.await`.
It does not reproduce Zig's synchronous-looking suspension mechanism.

Prefer generic traits and concrete future types initially. Runtime selection
can happen when constructing the application. Supporting different runtimes
does not require a trait object or heap allocation for every operation. Add
dynamic dispatch where a real caller needs runtime selection at that boundary.

### Candidate package boundaries

The workspace currently contains `socketry` and `socketry-executor`. The other
names below describe possible extractions from the executor, not packages to
publish before they have code. Split modules into packages when consumers or
optional dependencies justify it.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `socketry` | Public facade, common exports, conventions, and agent context. |
| `socketry-executor` | Future execution, workers, task ownership, barriers, cancellation, and integration with I/O selectors and timers. |
| `socketry-io` | Portable I/O contracts, resource and buffer ownership, and stream interfaces. |
| `socketry-timers` | Timer ordering, cancellation, and batching, independent of an executor or OS selector. |
| `socketry-tokio` | Tokio implementations of the portable contracts and focused compatibility adapters. |

Keep protocol parsing and serialization independent of the runtime wherever
possible. Higher-level protocol packages need not live in this repository.

## Execution and ownership

The executor polls pinned future state on worker threads' ordinary stacks.
Use Send futures for tasks eligible to run on different workers. A local task
facility can accept non-Send futures with explicit thread restrictions.
Pinned future storage stays at a stable address while the worker allowed to
poll it may change. Only one worker may poll a task at a time.

The scheduler owns top-level tasks. A parent task explicitly owns child groups
through barriers. Both a scheduler and a barrier expose the spawning contract,
so accepting connections can take either as its task owner. The owner controls
the task lifetime; execution still goes through the selected executor.

- Spawning registers ownership before a task can run.
- Joining reports completion and failures to the owner.
- Waiting for a barrier waits for its owned children.
- Stopping requests cancellation and waits for termination and cleanup.
- Closing an owner prevents new children from escaping into a stopping group.
- Dropping a public handle must have a documented policy; it must not
  accidentally detach a child that still belongs to a barrier.

Use owned, `'static` futures for independently spawned tasks initially. A
parent-child relationship alone does not make borrowing a parent's local
variables safe. Scoped borrowing requires a separate lifetime design that
remains sound when futures or handles are dropped or forgotten.

### Cleanup in a future executor

Stable Rust's Drop implementation cannot await. A barrier destructor can
request cancellation, but cannot promise that children on other workers have
finished cleanup when it returns. An explicit `stop().await` can wait.

For automatic ownership cleanup, the executor must retain the task/group
record while children drain. It can delay reporting the parent as fully
terminated until descendants finish. This is a task lifecycle guarantee; it
does not keep every local variable in a dropped parent future alive.

Distinguish cooperative cancellation, dropping a future, and waiting for
termination. Dropping a future runs synchronous destructors but does not run
the remainder of its async body. Graceful asynchronous shutdown requires a
live future that the runtime continues to poll. Runtime shutdown must define
how cancellation and pending I/O completions are drained.

Contextual APIs such as `Scheduler::current()` can remain conveniences. Set
and restore their context around every poll, including when polling panics;
do not assume a future always runs on the thread where it was created.

### Current executor

The implementation currently lives in socketry-executor. async-task owns
pinned future storage and its runnable/waker state. Socketry supplies thread
management, ownership, cancellation flags, task identity and queue selection.
Each worker has a FIFO Crossbeam queue plus an incoming injector for remote
wakeups. External submissions enter a global injector; worker submissions go
to that worker's queue. Wakeups target the last worker. Only workers without
their own work steal from other local queues or incoming queues.

Periodic external checks prevent a busy local queue from starving submissions.
Idle flags and a post-registration queue search coordinate parking and wakeups.
Task registration and completion use an ownership mutex; ordinary polling and
wakeups use the task state and queues without that mutex.

Scheduler, SchedulerHandle and Barrier implement Spawn. Its associated handle
type permits runtime-specific join implementations. Public TaskHandle drop
abandons a result while leaving execution owned. Awaiting it reports output,
cancellation or a panic payload. Barrier wait/stop join direct children; parent
termination does not yet automatically wait for descendants. Explicitly await
barriers when that guarantee is required.

Native I/O and sleep capabilities now accompany the executor. Regular-file
fallbacks use blocking pools; there is no public blocking-task API or local
non-Send task executor. Coroutine sources and historical tests are preserved
on their branch and are no longer built by this workspace.

## Compatibility with Tokio and other runtimes

Separate three levels of compatibility:

1. A future that needs only standard polling and wakeups can run on a suitable
   executor, subject to its Send and lifetime requirements.
2. A library written against portable spawn, clock, and I/O contracts can use
   different implementations of those contracts.
3. A library that directly calls Tokio APIs needs the relevant Tokio runtime
   services. Implementing an I/O trait does not replace those services.

Tokio and futures-io expose different AsyncRead and AsyncWrite traits.
`tokio-util::compat` already adapts these traits in both directions. Reuse
those adapters where they fit. An adapted Tokio socket still belongs to its
Tokio I/O driver, which must remain alive and be driven.

Entering a Tokio runtime context provides access to its services; entering
alone does not drive the runtime. Some mixed execution is possible when the
required services are running, but must be established for the concrete APIs
being used. Do not advertise universal Tokio compatibility from a Waker or
stream adapter alone.

The optional `scheduler::tokio` adapter implements Network, FileIo, Clock and
Spawn against an existing runtime. It preserves direct-child barrier ownership
and joins owned task destruction on asynchronous shutdown. The same generic
TCP program runs on Socketry and Tokio. The adapter scopes runtime context to
individual polls when registering resources; its futures can also be polled by
Socketry workers while Tokio drives the underlying services. Socketry contextual
lookups still identify Socketry execution; portable code passes handles explicitly.

For existing libraries tied to Tokio, either keep their work on Tokio
and bridge owned messages/results, or provide the particular trait adapter
they consume. Avoid a broad imitation of Tokio's API.

## I/O and io_uring

Account for completion-based I/O before fixing the portable API. An operation
submitted to io_uring may still access its buffer after the Rust future
waiting for it is dropped. A borrowed byte slice and a synchronous destructor
are not sufficient to establish that the kernel has stopped using memory.

Use an operation model that transfers ownership of a stable buffer to the
selector and returns it with the result on completion. The selector retains the
buffer and required descriptor ownership until it knows all kernel accesses
are finished, even when the caller abandons its future. Requesting cancellation
does not by itself prove that the original operation has finished.

Plan for:

- Reusable buffers, resource registrations, and operation records.
- Batched submission and completion processing.
- Backpressure when submission capacity or buffer pools are exhausted.
- Distinguishing cancellation requests from original operation completions.
- Preventing late completions from referencing a recycled operation record.
- Runtime capability probing and explicit fallback or unsupported errors.
- Non-Linux implementations using suitable readiness or OS completion APIs.

A borrowed-buffer AsyncRead/AsyncWrite facade can sit above an owned-buffer
selector using internal buffers when necessary. Document the copying and
buffering costs of adapters. Do not require the lowest-level io_uring API to
pretend every operation has borrowed-buffer semantics.

Keep ring ownership explicit. The initial implementation uses a dedicated
selector thread. Work stealing routes operations to that selector without
moving their registrations. A pinned address does not establish Send.

Tokio-uring is useful reference code for owned-buffer operations. It has its
own driver/runtime requirements; using it does not make ordinary Tokio I/O
and io_uring interchangeable.

### Current selectors

The implementations live under `scheduler/selector/`, selected with Cargo
features and target configuration. epoll, kqueue and iocp expose shared async-io
readiness operations; the process-wide reactor owns persistent registrations.
Windows uses IOCP/AFD socket readiness. Regular-file fallback operations use a
blocking pool, because readiness does not make ordinary file I/O nonblocking.

The Linux `io-uring` feature selects a dedicated ring for socket/file reads and
writes. Connect, accept, explicit readiness waits and sleep still use async-io.
Initialization probes required opcodes and reliable completion overflow; it
returns an error if unavailable rather than silently changing implementation.
Shutdown cancels and drains original completions. Operation identifiers are
never reused, and cancellation completions cannot release original buffers.
Unexpected selector failure retains resources whose kernel lifetime cannot be
established and panics their waiting operations. Normal cancellation does not
retain completed resources.

The current owned-buffer API uses Vec values and returns `(io::Result<usize>,
Vec<u8>)`. Read buffers must already have an initialized length. Operations may
be partial; dropping a waiting future can abandon I/O that consumes or transmits
bytes. Socket and listener types are associated with the concrete implementation.
Tokio registrations reject use through another runtime's adapter.

This is an initial implementation: each ring operation uses a command and a
completion channel, and operation records and buffers are not pooled. General
descriptors, UDP and native overlapped Windows files remain future work.
Blocking file operations can outlive task cancellation; neither Socketry nor
the Tokio adapter shuts down the process-wide or external blocking pool.

## Timer port

The source reviewed is socketry/io-event commit
`66caf64fbe27d752e4c64a60a7d0fba8bceaddbc`:

- `lib/io/event/timers.rb`
- `lib/io/event/priority_heap.rb`
- `test/io/event/timers.rb`
- `test/io/event/priority_heap.rb`

This is a binary min-heap with deferred insertion and lazy cancellation.
Preserve these choices in the Rust port:

- Scheduling appends to a pending batch; heap insertion is deferred.
- Cancellation clears the payload and updates bookkeeping in constant time.
- Cancelled pending timers are filtered before insertion.
- Cancelled timers at the heap root are removed when querying or firing.
- Compact the heap when at least 128 retained entries are cancelled and
  cancelled entries are more than half the heap.
- Clear an entirely cancelled heap even below that threshold when there is
  no live pending batch.
- Combine compaction and pending insertion into one heap rebuild.
- Build from empty or rebuild when the incoming batch exceeds twice the
  existing heap size; otherwise insert incrementally.

Keep the timer queue independent of a scheduler, OS sleep, or Tokio. Let the
selector provide monotonic time and consume expired entries. An executor-facing
sleep future registers a waker with the selector, which uses the queue to choose
its next wake deadline. Wake callbacks outside queue locks.

Use Instant/Duration or an explicit monotonic tick type rather than floating
point deadlines. Accept the current time explicitly in queue operations so
behavior can be checked without wall-clock sleeps. Record where Rust behavior
differs: expired deadlines can use a zero wait duration, and public live counts
should be distinguished from retained cancelled entries.

Reusable registration handles must not allow an old cancellation to affect a
new timer occupying the same storage. Document reset behavior and whether it
reuses an allocation. Preserve MIT attribution for Samuel Williams and Wander
Hillen, the source paths, and the revision used for the translated code.

The algorithm's existing Ruby performance motivates the port. Rust performance
claims require measurements of scheduling, cancellation, expiration, batching,
and retained memory under representative workloads.

## Implementation sequence

1. Record boundaries and reusable Rust conventions (implemented).
2. Replace stackful execution with async-task and Crossbeam worker queues
   (implemented). Keep the coroutine prototype in its saved branch.
3. Implement explicit owners, barriers, cancellation and shutdown (implemented
   for direct children). Automatic descendant draining remains future work.
4. Establish minimal clock and I/O contracts with concrete consumers
   (implemented with Network, FileIo, Clock and a portable TCP example).
5. Implement native readiness and the Tokio adapter, running the same consumers
   with both (implemented). Native sleep uses async-io until the timer port.
6. Implement io_uring's owned-buffer lifecycle, socket/file operations,
   cancellation and runtime probing (implemented). Improve operation reuse,
   buffer registration and submission backpressure in subsequent work.
7. Port the timer queue with upstream attribution and deterministic verification.
8. Measure the executor and complete system. Multiple workers and work stealing
   are implemented, but performance claims require benchmarks.

When implementation verification is requested, cover timer threshold
boundaries, duplicate and late wakeups, cancellation races, parent cleanup,
I/O dropped in flight, and backend compatibility. Linux execution is required
to establish io_uring behavior; a build on another platform does not do so.
